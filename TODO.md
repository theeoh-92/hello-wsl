# TODO

## QOL Updates

- Refactor code a bit and make it more class/component based ✅ (Turns out there was barely any components that could be differentiated lol...)
- Define and serve the font locally rather than pulling from CDN
- Add a meta description

## Fixes

- Link elements do not have sufficient contrast with the background
- Link touch target for mobile devices is too small
